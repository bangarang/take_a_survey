# Take A Survey
Built on a mac for a mac.

Get it up and Running. Start mysql in 1 terminal window:

	mysqld

And in another install the dependancies:

	npm install

From there, you can start it standard:

  	npm start

Or run the gulpfile and check out my dev setup:

  	gulp

## Make A Survey

Go to [http://localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) to make a new survey, add options to choose from and see how many answers each option has gotten. Add a few questions and then head over to the root to *take some survey* or a few of them: [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
